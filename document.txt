1) Clone needed repository in your web root:

clone git repository.

2) create dev branch.

$ git branch new_branch
3) Change git branch to the new_branch

$ git checkout new_branch
4) Do coding, commits, as usual…

$ git add .
$ git commit -m “Initial commit”
$ git push (pushes commits only to “new_branch”)
5) When job is finished on this branch, merge with “master” branch:

$ git merge master
$ git checkout master (goes to master branch)
$ git merge development (merges files in localhost. Master shouldn’t have any  commits ahead, otherwise there will be a need for pull and merging code by hands!)
$ git push (pushes all “new_branch” commits to both branches - “master” and “new_branch”)
